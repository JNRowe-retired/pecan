A WSGI object-dispatching web framework, in the spirit of TurboGears, only 
much much smaller, with many fewer dependancies.

TODO
====

 * Change to alternate routing code lifted from Rick Copeland's
   clutch:
   
       http://code.google.com/p/pyclutch/source/browse/trunk/clutch/controller_lookup.py
   
   This gives me support for _lookup controllers, which I don't
   currently have.
 
 * Switch "hooks" over to Context Managers.
 
 * Remove requirement for simplejson, since we should be using
   Python's built-in JSON.
 
 * JSONify dates as isoformat strings by default.
